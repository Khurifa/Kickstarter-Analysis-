## Analysis and Challenges
There were a lot of challenges, building the data to what the direction tobe followed, One
of the difficult task was to change the number to different format because if you don't
do that the outcome is very different and Pivot table would not come out the correct way
and your graph would be hard to read. I think that knowing excel and having a lot of experience
in would help and of course following directions and re reading over and over again.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I have noticed that that failed and successful rate meets at one point December of
and outcome of 25th I also noticed that rate for failure is much higher in May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I conclude that success is alway higher, However at the end successfulness
and failed at one point

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Honestly I dont see any limitations


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I think that histogram would be also very beneficial for this  informational graph.
It would be interesting to see why it failed
